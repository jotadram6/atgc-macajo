aTGC analyses->

WZ -> lvl+l-, 7 TeV, ATLAS 
Observables: Number of events after selection by channel (eee, emumu, muee, mumumu), M(WZ), pT(Z)*
http://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.1390.pdf

WW -> lvlv, 7 TeV, CMS & ATLAS
Observables: TBD + pTmax*

WW -> lvlv, 8 TeV, CMS
Observables: Number of events per category (0-jet, 1-jet), pT(l,max), pT(ll), DeltaPhi(ll), m(ll)*
http://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.03268.pdf

WW+WZ with W->lv and W or Z -> jj, 7 TeV, ATLAS
Observables: Number of events after selection by channel (e, mu), M(jj), pT(jj)*
http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.7238.pdf

WW+WZ with W->lv and W or Z -> jj, 7 TeV, CMS
Observables: Number of events after selection by channel (e, mu), M(jj), pT(jj)*
http://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.7544.pdf

WZ+ZZ with Z->bb and W->lv or Z->ll,vv
Observables: Signal strength for WZ and ZZ separately, M(bb)
They didn't looked for aTGC.

Wgamma -> lvgamma, 7 TeV, CMS & ATLAS
Observables: TBD + pTgamma*

NOTES: 
- The asterisk indicates the bservable used to set bounds on aTGC;
- D0 and CDF also looked for aTGC in the same channels. Curiosity: they didn't analyzed either the channel WZ -> jjll. What's going on with this channel?
